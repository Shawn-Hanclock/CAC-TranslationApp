# Title- Language Helper
## Prototype Android App: 
Created for the congressional app contest 2023. Although rushed in it's creation, the main idea was to create an application that would be able to translate written text into spoken word.
There were no explicit directions given on this project, any ideas what you could think of and execution based on your own knowledge.

## Features:
1. OCR Scan, via another github repository
2. TTS, via android development kit
3. Editable text box, output of OCR scan and input for TTS
4. Two seperate pages/screens
